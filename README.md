## üèó How to deploy your own?

### Domain preparation
If you own a domain you can deploy it, in in the subdomain with simple `CNAME` record added to yor DNS Zone. In my case `CNAME` record for `id.zentala.io` points at my GitHub profile `zentala.github.io.`. 

If you don't own domain you still can host webpage under `github.io` domain: `<your_github_username>.github.io`.

For more about GitHub Pages configuration go to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). 

### Code preparation
* fork this repo and rename it into choosen domain name 
* edit `package.json` and go to `scripts` > `deploy`, change `id.zentala.io` to your domain name & commit
* edit `README.md` and replace repository URL with yours in GitPod link & commit
* install [GitPod from Marketplace](https://github.com/gitpod-io) and turn it on in the repository
* open project with GitPod & change all titles, icons, descriptions you want to change & commit
* deploy with `npm run deploy` (that will create branch `deploy` with built website)

### Turing on GitHub Pages
* having branch `deploy` built, and domain configured...
* go to repository `Settings` > `Pages`
* choose `deploy` branch from the list, click `Save`
* wait till TLS cert will be generated (that may take around 15min), check `Enforce HTTPS`

Congrats. Your website should be avaliable under choosen domain name!
